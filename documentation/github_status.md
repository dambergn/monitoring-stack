Of course! Monitoring the GitHub status page is a great use case for Grafana. It gives you a single place to see if a potential production issue is caused by your own systems or by a critical dependency like GitHub.

Since the GitHub status page is a public service with a JSON API, you don't need Prometheus for this. You can pull the data directly into Grafana.

The best and most direct way to do this is using the **Infinity data source plugin**. This plugin is designed to query data from JSON, CSV, XML, and other web APIs directly.

Here is a step-by-step guide.

---

### Method 1: The Easy Way (Using the Infinity Plugin)

This method is perfect for simple visualization without needing to set up another service.

#### Step 1: Find the GitHub Status API URL

The GitHub status page is hosted by Atlassian Statuspage, which provides a standard JSON API endpoint.

The URL you need is:
`https://www.githubstatus.com/api/v2/summary.json`

(You can open this in your browser to see the raw data you'll be working with.)

#### Step 2: Install the Infinity Plugin

1.  In your Grafana instance, go to the side menu.
2.  Navigate to **Administration -> Plugins**.
3.  In the search bar, type `Infinity`.
4.  Click on the plugin and then click the **Install** button.
5.  Grafana will ask you to restart the Grafana server for the plugin to be enabled. Do this if prompted. (For Grafana Cloud or Docker-based installs, the restart might happen automatically or require a container restart).

#### Step 3: Configure the Infinity Data Source

1.  Navigate to **Configuration / Connections -> Data sources**.
2.  Click **Add new data source**.
3.  Search for and select **Infinity**.
4.  You don't need to change any settings here. The default configuration is fine for a public, unauthenticated API. Just give it a name like `GitHub Status` and click **Save & test**.

#### Step 4: Create a Dashboard Panel

Now for the fun part. Let's create a panel to show the status of all GitHub components.

1.  Go to a new or existing dashboard and click **Add -> Visualization**.
2.  In the query editor at the bottom, select your `GitHub Status` data source.
3.  Configure the Infinity query:
    *   **Type**: `JSON`
    *   **Source**: `URL`
    *   **Parser**: `Backend` (this is usually the best default)
    *   **URL**: Paste the URL from Step 1: `https://www.githubstatus.com/api/v2/summary.json`
    *   **Root / Path**: This tells Infinity where the array of data is. Looking at the JSON, the components are in an array called `components`. So, type `components`.

4.  Define your **Columns / Fields**:
    *   **Column 1:**
        *   Selector: `name`
        *   Alias: `Component`
    *   **Column 2:**
        *   Selector: `status`
        *   Alias: `Status`
        *   Type: `String`

At this point, you should see data appear in a table in your panel preview.

#### Step 5: Choose the Right Visualization

Now you can make it look good. With the data queried, select a visualization from the top-right panel list.

**Option A: Status History (Best Choice)**
This panel is perfect for this kind of data.
1.  Change the Visualization to **Status history**.
2.  In the panel options, you may need to map the fields:
    *   **Value field**: `Status`
    *   **Display name**: `Component`
3.  Map the status values to colors under the **Value mappings** section in the panel editor. This makes the status immediately obvious.
    *   `operational` -> Green
    *   `degraded_performance` -> Orange
    *   `partial_outage` -> Orange
    *   `major_outage` -> Red



**Option B: A Simple Table**
If you just want the list, the **Table** visualization works out of the box with the query from Step 4. You can use **"Organize fields"** transform to hide unwanted columns.

### Method 2: The Advanced Way (Prometheus + Exporter)

This method is more complex to set up but gives you powerful advantages:
*   **Historical Data:** You can see exactly when GitHub's status changed over time.
*   **Alerting:** You can use Prometheus Alertmanager to send you a Slack/PagerDuty/Email alert if `Git Operations` has a `major_outage`.

#### The Concept

You run a small application called an **exporter**. This exporter queries the `githubstatus.com` API every minute, converts the status into Prometheus metrics, and exposes them. Prometheus then scrapes the exporter.

1.  **Run a Statuspage Exporter:** There are several available. A popular one is `slok/statuspage-exporter`. You would run this as a Docker container or a small service.
    ```bash
    docker run -d --restart=always -p 9577:9577 slok/statuspage-exporter --page-url=https://www.githubstatus.com
    ```
2.  **Configure Prometheus:** Add a scrape job to your `prometheus.yml` file to scrape this exporter.
    ```yaml
    scrape_configs:
      - job_name: 'github-status'
        static_configs:
          - targets: ['localhost:9577'] # Or the IP where the exporter is running
    ```
3.  **Grafana:** In Grafana, you would point your panel to your **Prometheus data source**. Your query would look something like this to get the status (where 1 = operational, 0 = not):
    ```promql
    statuspage_component_status{page="GitHub", component="Git Operations"}
    ```

### Comparison: Which Method to Use?

| Feature | Method 1: Infinity Plugin | Method 2: Prometheus Exporter |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Simplicity** | **Excellent.** No extra services needed. | **Complex.** Requires running an exporter and configuring Prometheus. |
| **Visualization** | Good for "current status" dashboards. | Excellent. Full historical data and graphing. |
| **Alerting** | Not possible directly. | **Excellent.** The primary reason to use this method. |
| **Resource Usage** | Very low. Just a simple API call. | Higher. Adds load to Prometheus and requires running an exporter. |

**Recommendation:**
Start with **Method 1 (Infinity plugin)**. Itâ€™s incredibly simple to set up and will satisfy the requirement of "seeing the GitHub status in Grafana" for 90% of users.

If you find that you need to **trigger alerts** or analyze historical uptime of GitHub, then invest the time to set up **Method 2**.
