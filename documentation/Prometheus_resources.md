Excellent question. Sizing Prometheus is a different and often more critical task than sizing Grafana, because Prometheus is the stateful "engine" that collects and stores the data. Its resource needs are directly tied to the volume and complexity of the monitoring data it handles.

While Grafana's load is based on *user activity*, Prometheus's load is based on the **monitoring workload** itself, which runs 24/7.

### The Quick Answer (TL;DR)

*   **Minimum (for testing/personal projects):**
    *   **CPU:** 2 cores
    *   **Memory:** 4 GB RAM
    *   **Disk:** 20 GB SSD (SSD is non-negotiable for performance)

*   **Recommended Starting Point (for a small-to-medium production environment):**
    *   **CPU:** 4 cores
    *   **Memory:** 8 - 16 GB RAM
    *   **Disk:** 100 - 200 GB high-performance SSD (e.g., NVMe)

### The Detailed Answer: It's All About the Data

Prometheus resource usage is driven by three main activities: **Ingestion**, **Storage**, and **Querying**.

Here are the key factors that influence its needs:

1.  **Cardinality (The #1 Factor for Memory):** This is the most important concept. Cardinality refers to the number of **unique time series** Prometheus is storing. A time series is a unique combination of a metric name and its key-value label pairs.
    *   `http_requests_total{method="GET", status="200"}` is one series.
    *   `http_requests_total{method="POST", status="200"}` is a second series.
    *   `http_requests_total{method="GET", status="500"}` is a third series.
    *   High-cardinality labels (like `user_id`, `request_id`, or `container_id` in a busy Kubernetes cluster) can cause the number of time series to explode, consuming a massive amount of RAM.

2.  **Ingestion Rate:** This is the number of samples (data points) Prometheus collects per second. It's determined by:
    *   **Number of Targets:** How many applications/servers are you scraping?
    *   **Scrape Interval:** How often do you scrape them? (e.g., every 15s, 30s, 60s). A shorter interval means a higher ingestion rate.
    *   This primarily impacts **CPU** and **Disk I/O**.

3.  **Query Load:** This is how often data is being read from Prometheus.
    *   **Grafana Dashboards:** Complex dashboards with many panels and long time ranges create high query load.
    *   **Alerting Rules:** Prometheus constantly runs queries in the background to evaluate your alert rules. Thousands of rules can create a significant, steady CPU load.
    *   This primarily impacts **CPU** and can also affect **Memory**.

4.  **Retention Period:** How long you store the data (e.g., 15 days, 30 days). This is the primary driver for **Disk Space**.

### The Critical Role of Disk I/O

This cannot be overstated. **Prometheus is extremely sensitive to disk performance.** It is constantly writing new data to a Write-Ahead Log (WAL) and then periodically compacting older data blocks in the background.

*   **Always use a local SSD.** NVMe SSDs are ideal.
*   **NEVER use network-attached storage (NFS, EFS, CIFS) or spinning hard drives (HDDs) for the main Prometheus database.** The high latency and low IOPS of these storage types will lead to poor performance, slow queries, and potentially data corruption under load.

### Sizing Scenarios (T-Shirt Sizing)

| Scenario | Active Time Series | CPU (vCPU) | Memory (RAM) | Disk Space (15d retention) | Disk Type |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Small / Dev** | < 100,000 | **2-4 Cores** | **8 GB** | ~50 GB | SSD (Required) |
| **Medium / Production** | 500,000 - 1,000,000 | **4-8 Cores** | **16 - 32 GB** | ~200 - 400 GB | Fast SSD / NVMe |
| **Large / Enterprise** | 2,000,000+ | **8-16+ Cores**| **64 - 128+ GB**| 500+ GB | High IOPS NVMe |
| **Very Large Scale** | 10,000,000+ | (N/A) | (N/A) | (N/A) | (N/A) |

**Note on "Very Large Scale":** A single Prometheus instance does not scale infinitely. At this level, you should look into a distributed, long-term storage solution like **Thanos, Cortex, or VictoriaMetrics**, which allows you to run multiple Prometheus instances and federate their data.

### How to Estimate Your Needs (Rule-of-Thumb Formulas)

You can make a rough estimate before you start.

1.  **Estimate RAM:**
    *   The biggest consumer of RAM is keeping track of the metadata for all active time series in its "head block."
    *   A very rough rule of thumb is **1-2 KB of RAM per active series**.
    *   So, for 1,000,000 series: `1,000,000 series * 2 KB/series ≈ 2 GB`. You then need to add significant overhead for queries, caching, and the OS itself, which is why 16GB+ is recommended for that scale.

2.  **Estimate Disk Space:**
    *   `storage_needed = retention_in_seconds * ingested_samples_per_second * bytes_per_sample`
    *   `bytes_per_sample` is typically **1-2 bytes** after compression.
    *   **Example:** 500,000 series scraped every 15 seconds.
        *   Ingested Samples/sec = 500,000 / 15s ≈ 33,333 samples/sec
        *   Retention = 15 days = 1,296,000 seconds
        *   Disk Space = `1,296,000 * 33,333 * 2 bytes` ≈ 86 GB
        *   Add a 20-30% buffer, so **~110 GB** would be a safe starting point.

### The Most Important Advice: Monitor Prometheus Itself!

Just like with Grafana, you must monitor your monitor.

1.  **Meta-monitoring:** The best practice is to have a second, smaller Prometheus instance scrape your main production Prometheus instance.
2.  **Use the `Prometheus / Overview` dashboard:** The `prometheus-community/prometheus` Grafana dashboard is excellent.
3.  **Key Metrics to Watch:**
    *   `prometheus_tsdb_head_series`: Your current **cardinality**. This is the most important metric for capacity planning.
    *   `prometheus_tsdb_compaction_duration_seconds`: If this is consistently high, your disk is too slow.
    *   `scrape_duration_seconds`: If scrapes are taking too long, it's a sign of a slow target or an overloaded Prometheus.
    *   `go_memstats_alloc_bytes`: The memory Prometheus is actually using.

**Conclusion:**

Start with the **recommended 4 Cores, 8-16 GB of RAM, and a fast 100GB+ SSD**. Monitor the `prometheus_tsdb_head_series` metric closely. This will be your primary indicator for when you need to provision more memory or begin planning for a more scalable, federated architecture.
